## What is it?
The Repeatable Threat Modeling Framework (RTMF) is a series of concepts, constructs, and flows that help enable repeatable threat modeling within organizations. The RTMF is not a guide for how to perform an individual threat model, but how to develop a threat modeling program unique to your organization's constraints. 

To learn how to perform an individual threat model, please see [[99 - Resources]].
## Why does it exist? 
The RTMF was created because while trying to develop threat modeling programs, there was a noted lack of publicly available methodologies that could help support individuals and organizations with these tasks. There are resources that can help guide the development of a threat modeling program, found within [[99 - Resources]], but the authors of RTMF did not find practical implementation and "day two" guidance.  
## What are the objectives?
The RTMF was developed with the following objectives in mind:
- Provide practical guidance for those trying to develop a threat modeling program
	- Provide the concepts and reasoning behind the guidance delivered, as not all organizations are created equal - there will be unique scenarios or objectives - providing the concepts can assist in the customization or knowing what can be ignored
	- Provide constructs that can be used to build from the concepts
	- Provide flows that can be used to tie everything together, should the 'default' configuration suite the reader's needs 
- Provide insights into any risks or issues observed from time spent in the field implementing programs and conducting threat models 
- Provide guidance for maturing and measuring progress 
- Provide the resources that influenced these efforts
	- **Because of the shoulders of giants, I can see** 
Although by following the 'defaults', a somewhat functional threat modeling program could exist, the RTMF authors encourage experimentation, iteration, and tailoring for the reader's desired outcomes and objectives.  
## How to use it?
Within the RTMF, each of the sections follow a hierarchy:
- [[02 - RTMF Principles]] exist at the base level - these should exist no matter the threat modeling program.
- [[03 - RTMF Constructs]] are the systems that exist as a result of the concepts, and will functionally be used during threat modeling activities. 
- [[04 - RTMF Flows]] are the workflows that are enabled through the constructs. This is how threat models should be conducted. 
	- **Note:** Additional flows are planned for a future release. 
- [[05 - Implementation, Maturity, and Continuous Improvement]] is a section that has steps for guidance in implementing the program, assessing the current maturity state, and improving the program over time. 
	- **Note:** This is planned for a future release. 
- [[99 - Resources]] contains resources that are recommended reference points for learning about threat modeling, conducting threat models, and implementing threat modeling programs.
